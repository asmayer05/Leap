Python code for reading Hall Effect outputs and translating Braille. Library for translation is included.

- When these files are changed, upload them to the Raspberry Pi (you should probably remove the current copy on the Pi as well)
- To upload the files to the pi, open up terminal and use the following command: scp <file directory> leap@<Raspberry Pi IP Address>:~ , "raspberrypi" being the IP address on the Pi.    - The Pi must be on and connected to the network.
- Another note: if you want to copy a file from the Pi,  use the following command in terminal: scp leap@< Raspberry Pi IP Address>:<file directory>
